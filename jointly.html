            <p class="p-description">
                This idea was born from self-analysis in a specific moment of self-sabotage related to the practice of physical exercises. I have always liked to run on the beach and I do it often, but there are certain times that other activities seem more important, or even the old laziness hits and then I suspend the run that day. 
                However, in the past, when I had the company of friends to go to the gym or jog somewhere, I felt more stimulated and was more committed. With their encouragement I kept myself consistent and lost 15kg. Physical activities performed with company are more fun and easier to accomplish. 
               <br/><br/>Given this context, Jointly is an application that enables you to exercise with a group of people who share the same interest as you. This engagement will generate a cycle of motivation: You will be motivated and you will motivate your colleagues.

                    <p class="description">• There are no groups for the user to join and he does not feel confident creating a group to lead.
                        <br/>• Users only use the app to find activity groups and once the group is known, the app is abandoned.
                        <br/>• Users only use the free mode (with advertisements)
                        <br/>• Lack of security at meetings, especially for women
                        </p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Possible mitigations</p>
                    <p class="description">• Dissemination of the app to formal exercise groups in the city.
                        <br/>• Lead user can be “rewarded” by creating a group
                        <br/>• The app can provide services that “hold” the user (allow posting training progress, photos, videos, etc.)
                        <br/>• Suggestion of meeting point in public and busy places. Easily share information and location with family members.
