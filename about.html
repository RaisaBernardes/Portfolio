                <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by. I have recently undergraduate in Computer Science
                and I'm currently looking for an opportunity to start my career in UX design. 
                I fell in love with this field about 1 year ago, a period which I dedicated 
                to exploring, studying the segment, and conducting my undergraduate thesis 
                whose theme consisted of usability in user experience design. Through this work, 
                I was able to strengthen my UX knowledge, connect with people and excitedly solve problems.
                <br>
                <br>Off work I love to sing, travel with my husband, run at the beach, and read good stories. 
                I always try to learn new things, challenge myself and connect with nature.
                <br>
                <br>I'll be happy to meet you, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
